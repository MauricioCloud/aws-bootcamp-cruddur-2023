# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

I got to use honeycomb and lift the app complete after rewatch the videos.

I had to be very careful as to put the vars correctly and run npm install on frontend files before running the conteiners.

Loved Honecomb.io, definitevily have to get more into Distributed tracing.

As I was out for work las week I had little time to keep up with homework.
