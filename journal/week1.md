Got Lost at the Live class after noticed that I connected gitpod to Visual Code desktop instead of the Browser Plug. Reconfigured the gitpod to open directly in browser and got better responses from the code. But then I got lost and the class was over.

I am reviewing the video again so I can follow up the whole practice so I can get the containers up and running and ready before going to see video week 2.
