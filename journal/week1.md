# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

Attended Live Week 1 Bootcamp.

Got on the Live Follow UP to create the Container:

Successfully built cd07fc90e290

Successfully tagged backend-flask:latest

Got Lost at the Live class after noticed that I connected gitpod to Visual Code desktop instead of the Browser Plug. Reconfigured the gitpod to open directly in browser and got better responses from the code. But then I got lost and the class was over.

I re-watched the video again so I can follow up the whole practice so I can get the containers up and running and ready before going to see video week 2.

Succesfully got Cruddur UP with Docker Compose at the end.

Had trouble to commit my changes on the code, so I had to start over re-creating the Docker Files, but then didnt worked again.
